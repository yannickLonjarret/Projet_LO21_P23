# **Schotten Totten**

A C++ implementation of the classic card game **Schotten Totten**, where players compete to control the battlefield using strategy, hand management, and tactical plays. This project simulates the game for either single-player (against AI) or two-player modes, with a user-friendly console-based interface. This was developed as part of a programming assignment for LO21 during the 2022-2023 academic year. The project was created by Rémi Bouchard, Bruniaux Aliénor, Pierre Lague, Yannick Lonjarret and Mondesert Jules.

## **About the Game**

**Schotten Totten** is a 2-player card game where players compete to win "stones" (or territories) on the battlefield. By forming poker-like combinations (e.g., runs, flushes) on each stone, players try to outscore their opponents and secure the majority of stones.

This project recreates the experience in a command-line format using the C++ programming language, offering both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI gameplay.
